python-login-script
===================

This is a basic login program for Python.

task is to:

1. setup basic login with a set username and password.
2. setup success and failure messages depending on input
3. enable the login details to be accessed by an external database
4. allow signup from a new users, records being added to the database.
5. allow a user to login and then change their password

The next stages can be built upon with more basics such as:

1. Can we allow this database to be accessed from different platforms? A web browser? A phone app? Can we put the database online and allow the program to access the database via an internet connection
2. decide what users are logging into / can they then "update their status" or "upload a picture" ?
3. Can they choose which usernames on the database they can share the picture with?


etc. The idea is endless :) We could build something that can be accessed from multiple platforms - web browser, android, iOS etc.
